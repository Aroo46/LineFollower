# LineFollower
My repository to store the SW for my Master studies project.
The aim of the project was to compare two different micros on managing the LineFollower Robot.

The project contains two main branches, one for the AVR microcontroller and one for the STM32 micro. 
In the master branch, you can find the short clip called "Algorytm_2_STM_poprawiony_najszybszy.MOV" which shows one of the test rides of my Line Follower.

Cheers
